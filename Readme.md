* Merge_L3A
This script helps producing mosaics over large regions, using Theia's L3A products, available from https://theia.cnes.fr
An example of mosaic of France is avalable here: http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/?p=14192

The script is written in bash.
It requires theia_download tool (available from my repository) and works with Gdal (at least V2.0).
